#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in fade-in fade-in fade-in fade-in) (1 2 3 4 5)
  1. What are the real-world impacts today of ubiquitous surveillance and engagement as a KPI?
  2. How do these factor into professional ethics for people working in Data Science?
  3. What is Information Warfare and how has it become a Commodity?
  4. How can we exploit the information marketplace in practice?
  5. How can we mitigate the damage of the current system?

** Content Warning
This talk will address some sensitive topics, including social,
political, and physical violence. Although I have tried to keep
discussions of these topics general, anyone who feels like they need
to limit exposure to these triggers may step away for the first
section of the talk.

* Real-world impacts of ubiquitous surveillance

** The things we think of

There are some common things that we discuss in the context of ad-tech

*** Annoying Ads

The most common problem when we thing of ad-tech and ubiquitious
surveillance is annoying ads.  How many times have you bought a new
sofa and been inundated with ads for sofas?

*** Media Fatigue

Impression driven revenue models, like advertising in social media,
are incentivized to drive increased engagement.  This can lead people
to be depressed or anxious as they are pulled deeper into media
cycles.

*** Online Harassment and Stalking

Data collected by advertisers can be compromised and used by harassers
and stalkers.

*** Attack Vectors

Ad-tech networks can be useful attack vectors for distributing
malware, cryptominers, and trackers.  As you'll see later in this
talk, many of these attacks are viable even for networks that disallow
javascript or otherwise attempt to sanitize payloads.

** The things we choose not to

There are also darker effects of the personalization and ad-tech
ecosystem.  As much as we might not want to think about them, these
are effects that we need to consider when evaluating the impact of
these technologies.

*** Gamergate and Neo-Nazi Recruitment

Groups can make use of personalization and engagement systems to drive
radicalization.  A number of facist and white nationalist groups are
actively exploiting algorithms on sites like YouTube to drive
radicalization.

*** Political Interference

Although advertising and propaganda have been a mainstay of politics
forever, recent trends toward using hyper-personalization in political
ads has changed the landscape.

*** Mass Shootings

Engagement loops and radicalization may be factors that drive mass
shootings.

*** Dissident Crackdowns

Many governments have leveraged ad-tech as a means of information
gathering as part of dissident crackdowns.  The ability to easily
profile someone based on their online activity and social connections,
and target them based on location, make the information economy a
natural ally of authoritarian governments.
