** About This Talk

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in fade-in fade-in fade-in fade-in) (1 2 3 4 5)
  1. What are the real-world impacts today of ubiquitous surveillance and engagement as a KPI?
  2. How do these factor into professional ethics for people working in Data Science?
  3. What is Information Warfare and how has it become a Commodity?
  4. How can we exploit the information marketplace in practice?
  5. How can we mitigate the damage of the current system?

** Content Warning
This talk will address some sensitive topics, including social,
political, and physical violence. Although I have tried to keep
discussions of these topics general, anyone who feels like they need
to limit exposure to these triggers may step away for the first
section of the talk.

* Real-world impacts of ubiquitous surveillance

** The things we think of

There are some common things that we discuss in the context of ad-tech

*** Annoying Ads

The most common problem when we thing of ad-tech and ubiquitious
surveillance is annoying ads.  How many times have you bought a new
sofa and been inundated with ads for sofas?

*** Media Fatigue

Impression driven revenue models, like advertising in social media,
are incentivized to drive increased engagement.  This can lead people
to be depressed or anxious as they are pulled deeper into media
cycles.

*** Online Harassment and Stalking

Data collected by advertisers can be compromised and used by harassers
and stalkers.

*** Attack Vectors

Ad-tech networks can be useful attack vectors for distributing
malware, cryptominers, and trackers.  As you'll see later in this
talk, many of these attacks are viable even for networks that disallow
javascript or otherwise attempt to sanitize payloads.

** The things we choose not to

[[./nazis.jpg]]

*** Gamergate and Neo-Nazi Recruitment

[[./milo.png]]

*** Gamergate and Neo-Nazi Recruitment

Groups can make use of personalization and engagement systems to drive
radicalization.  A number of facist and white nationalist groups are
actively exploiting algorithms on sites like YouTube to drive
radicalization.

*** Political Interference

[[./brexit.jpg]]

Although advertising and propaganda have been a mainstay of politics
forever, recent trends toward using hyper-personalization in political
ads has changed the landscape.

*** Mass Shootings

Engagement loops and radicalization may be factors that drive mass
shootings.

*** Dissident Crackdowns

[[./umbrella.jpg]]

*** Dissident Crackdowns

Many governments have leveraged ad-tech as a means of information
gathering as part of dissident crackdowns.  The ability to easily
profile someone based on their online activity and social connections,
and target them based on location, make the information economy a
natural ally of authoritarian governments.

*** Genocide

*** Genocide

Groups like ICE are able to make use of clique identification,
location tracking and targeting to identify and target individuals and
groups for capture.

* How do these factor into professional ethics for people working in Data Science?

** Considering Externalities Of Our Systems

The harm that the information economy does is often indirect.  We need
to consider indirect effects when building systems.

** Considering The Scale of Impact

Scale matters.  While we would prefer to avoid all individual harm,
it's important to realize that the scale of impact has grown to the
point where it can cause massive social and political changes with
long-term and broad-reaching consequences.

** Moral Culpability of Secondary and Tertiary Effects

Understanding the depth and scope of the problem, we must put some
degree of moral culpability on the builders of these systems for their
secondary and tertiary effects.

* What is Information Warfare?

[[./spy.jpg]]

** Information Warfare Is About People

Much of information warfare comes down to people- extracting
information from them, or using (real or false) information to
influence them.  The information economy has commoditized both.

*** Mass Communication

Mass communication, usually in the form of propaganda, is an important
part of information warfare.  Mass communication allows a message to
be widely distributed among a population in order to affect group
behavior.

*** Targeting Groups and Individuals

In addition to untargetted mass communication, information warfare
often involves targeting individuals or specific groups.  This allows
messages to be tailored to individuals and groups, and groups to be
influenced in more fine-grained ways.

*** Collecting and Exploiting Knowledge

Effective information warfare requires that knowledge be collected and
exploited.  This can take several different forms, and we'll look at
several of them throughout this talk.

** These Aren't New Techniques

*** The Long History of Propaganda

[[./triumph.png]]

*** Spycraft During The Cold War (And Before)

Spycraft has existed for all of human history, but the cold war saw an
explosion in the awareness of spycraft in the modern consciousness.
These techniques, have continued to grow and be refined.

*** McCarthyism And Social Networks As Tools of Persecution

[[./mccarthy.jpg]]

* The Information Economy

[[./adtech.png]]

** Surveillance Capitalism

Surveillance capitalism is a broad term that refers to the
commodification of personal information.  The information economy is
the market on which surveillance capitalism runs.

*** The Ad-Tech Ecosystem

The ad-tech ecosystem is the core of the information economy.  Supply
and demand side providers, data management platforms, content delivery
networks, and more all work together to monetize personal information
through

*** Engagement as an Investment Metric

*** Engagement and Retention Services

*** Consumer Demand for Personalization
