* Monadic Error Handling in Go
** Wut?
*** Monads are an interface
** Why?
*** I Hate Writing Tests
*** But I like Working Code
* I love Go... I Hate Go!
** Error Handling Sucks!
*** Verbose
*** Intention Muddled
*** Write Everything Twice
*** Tests!
** What If...
*** We could separate error handling from logic
*** We could handle errors once
*** The Compiler Could Catch Errors
** Errors As Values
*** Slight Improvement
*** The idioms are broken
*** WET
* Idioms
** What Are Idioms
*** Shorthand for communication
*** Patterns that let us think more quickly
*** We have to be careful not to overfit
** Go Allows us to be Expressive
*** High Order Functions
*** Runtime Type Introspection
*** Automatic Interface Fullfilment
** Go's Idioms Discourage These Patterns
