#+title: Haskell Deep Learning: Presentation Notes

* Introduction
What we'll cover (this isn't a highly technical presentation)

  - Why Haskell is a Good Fit for ML
  - The State of Deep Learning in Haskell
    - Lots of companies doing it:
      - Target
      - Takt
      - FinTech
    - Some library support
      - TensorFlow
      - Grenade
      - Caffe
  - Other Types of ML in Haskell

* Why Haskell?
